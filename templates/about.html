    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>I was born on August 6, 2002. I have two brothers both of which are younger than me.
        My family has a dog breeding business where we breed <em>poodles</em>, <em>goldendoodles</em>,
        <em>bernedoodles</em>, and <em>sheepadoodles</em> of all sizes. From a young age I have known how
        to raise and deliver puppies. In my home alone we have 9 pets and at my grandmas
        house, the main place of operation, we have just about 50 dogs who are all loved
        and cared for.</p>
